# Welcome

My name is Joel, and this is a new site for me to share...well, I haven't completely hashed out what will live here, but for now check out [hiking trails around Omaha, NE](local-hiking) and my landing page at [joelheaps.com](joelheaps.com).

***Thanks to:***

- *[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the static-site generator faithfully building these pages.*
- *[Herman Martinus and Bear Blog](https://herman.bearblog.dev/) for inspiring this blog and the theme it uses.*
- *[janraasch's `hugo-bearblog` theme](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog), for saving me the legwork of copying the Bear Blog theme by hand.*

# Welcome!

I'm Joel, a software developer and systems engineer from Omaha, Nebraska (US).  I currently build and operate data management and processing pipelines using Python, and occasionally provide network operations and Linux sysadmin support.  I love learning and solving tough problems, and when I'm not at work or on a trail, I'm often tinkering with my homelab or trying to pick up a new programming language.

## More things I do

💻 Software development

  - Data processing systems design
  - Python application development
  - Application containerization and orchestration (using Docker, k8s)

🌐 Network engineering

  - Routing, switching, and config automation

✈️ Flying

  - Flight Instructor (CFI), with Commercial license (CPL) and instrument rating; I mostly fly for fun these days.

⛺ Outdoorsy stuff

  - Hiker and [OpenStreetMap contributor](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/joelheaps); I map local trails them so others can find them too.
  - Skiing

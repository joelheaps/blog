# Welcome!

My name is Joel, and this is a new place for me to share...well, I haven't completely hashed out what will live here, but for now check out [hiking trails around Omaha, NE](omaha-hiking) and my landing page at [https://joelheaps.com](https://joelheaps.com).  This is also a place to get my feet wet with `HTML` and `Javascript`.

### **Thanks to**:

- [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/), for a neat static website generator.
- [**janraasch's `hugo-bearblog` theme**](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog) for a simple, clean base to build this site on.
- [**Herman Martinus and Bear Blog**](https://herman.bearblog.dev/) for the original theme and a little inspiration to actually start a blog.
- [**altrdev's `hugo-leaflet` project**](https://github.com/altrdev/hugo-leaflet), which serves as the base for the map elements on this site.

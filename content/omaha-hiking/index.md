# Omaha, Nebraska Local Hiking

{{< dropcap char="T" >}}his is a collection of some of my favorite hiking venues around the Omaha, Nebraska area, **organized roughly from North to South**.  It's a mix of parks, forests, and wildlife preserves within about an hour of the metro.  Most of these places have a network of trails that are worth checking out, but sometimes I'll point out a specific one if it's notable.

## Sarah's Trail from Preparation Canyon to Jones Creek Pond

**Location:** [Loess Hills State Forest near Moorhead, IA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QY76BzfAHYM2XgRk7)

**Distance:** 3.3 mi

A relatively easy pine-covered trail following a ridge down from one of the main access roads in Preparation Canyon State Park.  Can be hiked either direction, either as an out-and-back, or one-way with a vehicle parked at either end.  The loop around the west side of Jones Creek Pond is worth the walk, but the hike can also be shortened by following the trail on the east side of the lake or by parking in the small lot where the trail crosses the road.

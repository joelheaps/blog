These are projects I'm working on, if only occasionally:

### KMEY.info

[KMEY.info](https://kmey.info) is a simple weather dashboard for my local airport, optimized to load over a slow connection.  MEY, or James Whiting Memorial Field of Mapleton, IA, doesn't have automatic weather observation equipment like other small airports, and has only a basic internet connectivity.  This page scrapes and pre-processes local weather data and presents a little landing page for airport info.

### SPC Notifier

[SPC Notifier](https://github.com/joelheaps/spc-notifier) is a simple little Python app that can send alerts about forecast discussions posted by NOAA's Storm Prediction Center.  Right now Discord is my chosen notification target.

### Windwise.app

[Windwise.app](https://windwise.app) is a simple route optimizer for US flights in small airplanes.  This site will be up and down as I experiment with data sources and route-finding algorithms.  One early realization is that for most short flights (within a couple hundred miles), wind patterns aren't varied enough to significantly impact flight time -- direct flights are *nearly* always quickest.  I might focus more on selecting ideal altitudes for cross-country flights.

### Other projects

- I'm learning Go, and participating in [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com).

# Omaha Hiking

This is a collection of some of my favorite hikes around the Omaha, NE area.

>💡 Work in Progress!

## Jones Creek Pond and Sarah's Trail
#### 📍 **Loess Hills State Forest, IA** • 3.3 mi

An easy hike near Moorhead, IA.  Can be hiked either direction, either as an out-and-back, or one-way with a vehicle parked at either end.  The loop around the west side of Jones Creek Pond is worth the walk, but the hike can also be shortened by following the trail on the east side of the lake or by parking in the small lot where the trail crosses the road.

## West Oak Forest
#### 📍 **Mills County, IA** • Mixed lengths (short)

West Oak forest is a small county park in the bluffs on the east side of the Missouri River with a network of relatively short trails (and steep climbs).  A loop on through the south ridgeline prairie and overlook is shown below.
